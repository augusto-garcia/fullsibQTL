Description: QTL mapping in outbred (outcrossing) species, considering a full-sib cross 
  (or F1 population) as a mapping population. It is assumed a previous genetic map obtained
  with 'onemap' package. The method is based on maximum likelihood approach using mixture 
  models and EM algorithm. The probabilities for QTL genotypes are inferred using multipoint 
  approach based on Hidden Markov Models. We implemented functions to perform interval mapping 
  (IM) and composite interval mapping (CIM). In a first step one need to scan the genome 
  for QTLs and after locating them, one can characterize these loci, i.e., it is possible to 
  estimate their effects, segregation pattern, and the linkage phase between QTL and markers.
